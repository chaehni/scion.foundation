SIDN Labs is currently experimenting with SCION and provides in the latest blog a brief update and looks ahead at the SCION-related work they have in the pipeline. Read <a href="https://www.sidnlabs.nl/en/news-and-blogs/experimenting-with-new-internet-infrastructures-scion">here</a>. SIDN Labs has connected its network to SCIONLab, the international testbed that interconnects around thirty sites. This means they are not using the current Internet (in particular BGP and the corresponding IP routing) but the native SCION routing. To evaluate how SCION performs in practice, they are implementing the SCION protocol in P4. SCION is part of the 2STiC research programme that experiments with emerging internet architectures in collaboration with NLnet Labs.

Several major Internet outages affected millions of users around the world during the month of June. A massive Google Cloud outage took outservice for most on the U.S. east coast, affecting third-party siteslike Discord, Snap, Vimeo and several of Google’s own services. Cloudflare suffered 2 outages, affecting Amazon, Linode and other major companies reliant on Cloudflare’s infrastructure. Also Facebook, Twitter and Apple suffered from an outage leading to restricted user interactions. This made evident, that Internet providers need to have better routing filters. A secure Internet Architecture like SCION could prevent such Internet-related outages. Its path-aware networking ensures that packets arrive at the targeted destination, by enabling circumvention of unavailable areas.

A research group at the University of Tennessee under Prof. Max Schuchard has devised a new form of DDoS attack, which they call the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07673.pdf">Maestro attack</a>. In their attack, the BGP protocol is exploited to focus botnet attack traffic onto a target link in the Internet, creating congestion on the link. The Maestro attack further strengthens the Crossfire attack, which is highly effective to conduct DDoS on today’s Internet. According to the researchers, although upgrades such as peer locking could help to prevent this specific attack, replacing BGP with an entirely new, next-generation system (e.g., SCION) would be the most effective solution.</p>

<p><strong>2019/06/15:</strong><br />
Security continues to be an important topic in today’s Internet. With the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as its weakest link, many loopholes are exploited for attacks (e.g. prefix hijacking), calling for a secure Internet architecture. An alternative to BGP is the SCION protocol which has a high level of security and can be verified by network operators, so that attacks can be prevented. Trust can be restored and hijacking completely avoided due to the fact that sender and receiver can define which path a packet takes (path-aware networking). Cryptographic verification of paths is also interesting for the financial sector, as described by an <a href="https://nzzas.nzz.ch/internet-architektur-scion-wie-die-eth-das-netz-sicherer-macht-ld.1489169?reduced=true">article</a> published by NZZ (in German)</p>

<p><strong>2019/06/07:</strong><br />
The SCION secure Internet architecture could have prevented the outage on Thursday last week, when for two hours, a large chunk of European mobile traffic was rerouted through China. The incident happened, because of a BGP route leak. The Boarder Gateway Protocol (BGP), that is used to reroute traffic at the ISP level, has been known to be problematic and BGP route leaks happen on a daily basis (<a href="https://bgpstream.com">https://bgpstream.com</a>). This time however, instead of ignoring the erroneous BGP announcement, China Telecom re-announced Safe Host’s information, resulting in a rerouting of European mobile networks trough China Telecom’s network. SCION makes the Internet more secure through path-aware networking and preventing BGP route leaks and prefix hijacking attacks.

A new amplification attack based on memcached is currently being abused in the wild. The largest attack the amplification factor is 10000 to 51000. This service is meant to cache data and reduce the strain caused by memory intensive services. Memcached servers require no authentication, and thus are vulnerable to reflection attacks using source address spoofing. A memcached driven attack with a bandwidth of 1.3 Tbps has been launched against the software development platform github.com <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/03/memcached-fueled-13-tbps-attacks.html">(article)</a>.</p>

<a href="https://bgpmon.net/bgp-leak-causing-internet-outages-in-japan-and-beyond/">BGP leak caused Internet outages in Japan and beyond</a>. Google accidentally leaked a big route table, the result of which was traffic from Japanese ISPs NTT and KDDI was sent to Google on expectation it would be treated as transit. SCION prevents such accidental BGP hijacks.</p>

HIDDEN COBRA is North Koreaâs DDoS Botnet Infrastructure. It has been used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally. SCION would help to ensure communication despite attacks. <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-164A">CERT TA17-164A</a></p>

The CrashOverride Malware is an extensible platform that could be used to target critical infrastructure sectors <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-163A">(CERT TA17-163A)</a>. Wired Magazine published an interesting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crash-override-malware/">article</a>. What is interesting about CrashOverride is that it can operate disconnected from the Internet. Thus, it is important to run a secure routing protocol, even in networks that claim to be secure because they are disconnected from the Internet. The SCION secure routing protocol could help in those cases.</p>
