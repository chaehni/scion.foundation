## High Security and Trust

- Public SCION connections offer properties only achieved today by expensive leased lines
  - Higher privacy through path transparency and selection of trustworthy paths
  - Geofencing for compliance with regulations
- Cryptographically secured packet forwarding
- Formal verification of protocols and code
- Common attacks become impossible by design:
  - No routing attacks
  - No DDoS attacks
  - No PKI attacks
